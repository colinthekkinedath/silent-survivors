          According to NPR.org around 81% Of Women Have Experienced Sexual Harassment, but 75% of cases go unreported. This clearly shows how sexual harassment is prevalent within the lives of women. However, when considering the fact that many women find these experiences embarrassing or vulnerable, it leads to them simply burying the trauma caused by such experiences. This is not the ideal way society must deal with such actions. As trauma can wear down one’s mental health and lead to negative long term effects such as depression.

          It is unacceptable that we live in a country where people are sexually assaulted every 68 seconds. This is why we started the silent survivors. As these cases grow, but the epidemic ceases to die, we must bring greater awareness to the public. The silent survivors not only allow survivors a safespace to vent out their trauma anonymously to others, but it also conveys the problem at hand by displaying a vivid picture of the severity of the problem as more cases are spoken of.
